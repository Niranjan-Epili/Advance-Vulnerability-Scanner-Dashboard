# Advanced Vulnerability Scanner

This is a Streamlit-based web application that performs advanced vulnerability scanning for URLs and files. The application checks for various security aspects of a URL, including HTTP headers, SSL/TLS certificate details, open ports, malware status, and more. It also supports file scanning using the VirusTotal API.

## Features

- **URL Scanning:**
  - Extract URL details (scheme, netloc, path, etc.)
  - Check if the URL uses HTTPS
  - Analyze HTTP headers for security best practices
  - Measure response time
  - Check content type
  - Scan for malware using the VirusTotal API
  - Retrieve SSL/TLS certificate details
  - Scan open ports (1-1024)
  - Retrieve WHOIS information
  - Check DNS records
  - Check social media presence (placeholder)

- **File Scanning:**
  - Upload and scan files using the VirusTotal API

- **Report Generation:**
  - Generate and download a report in Excel format with all scanning results.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ````bash
   ``git clone https://github.com/Niranjan-Epili/Advance-Vulnerability-Scanner-Dashboard.git``

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
    ````bash
    ``python -m venv venv``
    ``source venv/bin/activate``   # On Windows use ``venv\Scripts\activate``
3. **Install the required dependencies:**

    ````bash
    ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
    
    
**Set up the environment variable:**

4. **You need to set up your VirusTotal API key as an environment variable.**

    Linux/MacOS:

    ````bash
    ``export VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY=your_virus_total_api_key``

    Windows:

    ````bash   
    ``set VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY=your_virus_total_api_key``

5. **Alternatively, you can use a .env file:**

    Create a .env file in the project directory and add the following line:

    ````env
    ``VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY=your_virus_total_api_key``

6. **Run the Streamlit application:**

    ````bash
    ``streamlit run app.py``
      
This will start the Streamlit server, and you can access the application in your browser at http://localhost:8501.
